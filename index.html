<h2>The Rise of Graffiti as an Art Form</h2>

  <h3>1. A Brief History of Graffiti</h3>
<p>Graffiti has roots that trace back to ancient civilizations, where markings on walls served as a form of communication and expression. However, modern graffiti began to take shape in the late 1960s and early 1970s in urban environments, particularly in New York City. Artists used spray paint to create tags and murals, often as a means of asserting their identity or making political statements. Over the decades, graffiti has transformed into a legitimate art form, with many artists gaining recognition in galleries and museums.</p>

<h3>2. Types of Graffiti</h3>
<p>Understanding the various styles of graffiti can enhance appreciation for graffiti events. Common types include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tagging: The simplest form of graffiti, involving the artist's name or pseudonym, often done quickly.</li>
<li>Throw-ups: More complex than tags, these usually involve two or more colors and require more time to execute.</li>
<li>Murals: Large-scale artworks that can take days or weeks to complete, often depicting intricate scenes or messages.</li>
<li>Stenciling: A method that uses pre-cut templates to create images quickly, often conveying social or political messages.</li>
<p>By recognizing these styles, participants can better appreciate the diversity and creativity showcased at graffiti events.</p>
